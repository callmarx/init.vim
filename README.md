Finally, I "organized" it!

## WSL
I'm using WSL2 with Arch linux, please see this [Readme](./WSL/README.md).

## Git
The [.gitconfig](./.gitconfig) files is kind of personal and mine isn't a big deal: it enables the
colors for commands like `$ git log`. I also defined the `develop` branch as the main and I use a
commit message template defined in [.gitmessage](./.gitmessage), which was inspired in
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Oh My Zsh
I use `zsh` shell with [*Oh My Zsh*](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) manager. To check if you
have it installed in your linux and if it is defined as default shell, use:
```bash
# Check if is installed
$ zsh --version

# Check if it is the default shell. You should receive 'bin/szh'
$ echo $SHELL
```

The [.zshrc](./.zshrc) file was basically generated by *Oh My Zsh* installer, I only added some
plugins. To install it, execute:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

I also use the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh) theme (**it
should have *NerdFonts* installed!**). To add in your *Oh My Zsh*, execute:
```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
Also add `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in your `~/.zshrc` (in my already has it).

## Nerd Fonts and emoji - **REQUIRED**


To install the whole nerdfonts package:
```sh
sudo pacman -S nerd-font
```

To install only one font, like **FireCode Nerd Font Regular** do:
```sh
sudo pacman -S ttf-firacode-nerd tf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
```

For emojis:

```sh
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-emoji
```

## Kitty Terminal Emulator - WIP

## My Neovim like an IDE
Set of plugins and settings that I use in Neovim. To organized it (and don't let it as a giant
single file) I spread my setup in other files as you can see in [nvim/lua/user](./nvim/lua/user),
keeping [init.lua](./nvim/init.lua) simple, only to load the other configuration files.

Packages that I usually need to install for a good `:checkhealth`:
```sh
sudo pacman -S wget fd ripgrep xclip
npm install -g neovim
gem install neovim rubocop rubocop-packaging rubocop-performance rubocop-rails rubocop-rspec
```

Copy, change and use it at will. Suggestions and (polite) criticism are welcome ðŸ¤“.

**NOTE**: To use the [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) icons you need to
install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) and enable in your terminal emulator profile or if
you use Tilix you can use my settings as I explained before.

For Neorg you need:
```bash
sudo pacman -S luarocks
```
and inside neovim execute:
```vim
:Neorg sync-parsers
```
## Spell Check and cohesion

To write my markdowns I use the ltex-ls LSP but for that you need to install java

```sh
sudo pacman -S openjdk-src
```

## My symbolic links

```sh
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshenv ~/.zshenv
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.asdfrc ~/.asdfrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/lazyvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/hypr ~/.config/
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/waybar ~/.config/
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/kitty ~/.config/
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/dunst ~/.config/
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/chrome-flags.conf ~/.config/
ln -s ~/dotfiles/config/code-flags.conf ~/.config/
```

## asdf

**NOTE:** For ruby you're going to need this packages as `ruby-build`'s requirements:

```sh
pacman -S --needed base-devel rust libffi libyaml openssl zlib
```

Download and install these languages:
```sh
# Ruby
asdf plugin add ruby https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git
asdf install ruby 2.7.1
asdf global ruby 2.7.1
# Python
asdf plugin add python
asdf install python 3.10.8
asdf global python 3.10.8
# Nodejs
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
asdf install nodejs latest
asdf global nodejs latest
# Golang
asdf plugin-add golang https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang.git
asdf install golang latest
asdf global golang latest
```

## Clear nvim installation (plugins)
```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/*
```
